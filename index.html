            <h2>Why Victoria Falls?</h2>
            <h3>A World of Wonders</h3>
            <p>
              Victoria Falls is classified as the largest, based on its combined
              width of 1,708 metres (5,604 ft) and height of 108 metres (354
              ft), resulting in the world’s largest sheet of falling water. It’s
              roughly twice the height of North America’s Niagara Falls. In
              height and width, Victoria Falls is rivalled only by Argentina and
              Brazil’s Iguazu Falls.
            </p>
            <p>
              During a full moon, something very special happens at Victoria
              Falls. As the sun sets on a full moon, the light from the moon
              bounces off the spray and illuminates a moonbow; a rainbow during
              the night. The spectacle lasts from sunset to sunrise and is one
              of Africa’s most distinctive and striking sights. Visitors have
              the chance to view the elephant, Cape buffalo, southern white
              rhinoceros, hippopotamus, giraffes, eland and a variety of other
              antelope herds during drives and walking safaris. A bask of
              crocodiles may be seen in the river, and a nearby Crocodile Ranch
              offers a safer view of these dangerous animals.

                <p>
                  The café serves a breakfast menu as well as a wide array of
                  options for lunch. Who can resist the freshly made dishes
                  which all have two things in common, creative names and the
                  obvious fusion of global cuisines? From English favourites to
                  Parisian delights, American, Italian and some African flavours
                  too. There is an interesting mesh of culinary delights, which
                  make all the dishes absolutely memorable!

                <p>
                  The noteworthy dishes include, the slow roasted oxtail, the
                  generous seafood platter which serves two, the delicious Lamb
                  not forgetting the Zambezi bream, a must have for all foreign
                  diners! All salads at Rain forest café are no small affair but
                  healthy, hearty and lavishly plated. The burgers are
                  definitely unconventional, and the prime Zimbabwean beef makes
                  them tastier. For the not so ordinary meal, some crocodile
                  tail is also available and comes highly recommended.

                  Traditional customs are observed while the sights and sounds
                  of the evening are accentuated by a feast of nightly
                  entertainment, incorporating Amakhwezi traditional dancers,
                  who captivate guests with their vibrant energetic songs and
                  dance. The acclaimed Zambezi Drumbeat provides a wonderful
                  interactive drumming experience, encouraging all diners to
                  take part in the evening's festivities. A meal at the Boma is
                  truly more than just a meal, it is an unforgettable
                  experience!
